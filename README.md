## Problem

The desire for quantitative, qualitative, individual tracing of livestock in the agricultural sector has created the need for more efficient data analysis, including image processing. Of this developments depends the formation of a truly efficient and useful technical farming sector. 

Image compression can be applied to many problems, methods have also been investigated for more classical interpolation problems such as zooming into an image by increasing its resolution

An efficient algorithm of image compression in the context of precision livestock farming allows to reduce costs and the accessibility to farms for implements software that help them to increase the lifetime of cattle.
